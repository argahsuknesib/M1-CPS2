## Aim from CPS2 Masters.
---
During my journey of applying into various masters programs, I had a special eye on the particular program because this program provided a mixture of knowledge required for research such as the modules related to artificial intelligence, and also utilized them to develop systems which could be of any sort, such as web applications, IOT applications.
I personally, as a hobby liked to learn about web development and data. Data is something, which can't be put into specific containers and subjects. Everything is data,and I like to work on data which can be developing machine learning models as well as representating them with an API and a front-end framework.

The CPS2 masters will help me include my  hobby of developing along with computer science research, particularly in *Multi Agent Systems*. *As of now*, I wish to come out of the Masters program after 2 years as a Research Student with emphasis on Multi Agent System applications.
I hope I'm egligible for a suitable position.
